This project was written in Kotlin, I have used MVVM architecture and also firebase to show updates on live.
The app aims for users who have dogs. each user can sign up for the app and upload a picture, then he can create his own events to meet with other people and their dogs, to got together for a walk,
in that way people can interact and meet new people and make friends. 
The user can attend to any event that was created besides the events he has created, to search for other user's profiles by their private name or by their dog's name and to comment for each user profile except his own profile.
Each user can delete any event he has created, or any comment he has commented on any user pfoile and to search for events in a specific city and to edit his own events such as the city name description date time.
There is ongoing mechanism in which deletes any event that the current date is beyond the date of the event that was created, also if user got deleted by an admin it will log him out from the app and it will delete all the events that this user has created since his user got deleted.
There is an option to see the event on google maps, based on the location the user has provided, if the location is corrupted the user will get a message saying it can't be opened in google maps since there is no such city.
